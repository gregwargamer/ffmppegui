# Collaboration and Documentation

When making changes to the codebase, you should refer to the `[project_map.md](mdc:project_map.md)` file.

This file serves as the single source of truth for the project's architecture and functionality. It is crucial that you keep this file up-to-date with any changes you make.

- **Before implementing a new feature or a change**, consult `[project_map.md](mdc:project_map.md)` to understand the existing structure.
- **After implementing a change**, update `[project_map.md](mdc:project_map.md)` to reflect the new state of the codebase.

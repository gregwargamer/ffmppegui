# FFMpeg Easy Distributed Project Analysis Report

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the `ffmpeg-easy-distributed` project, examining each file to identify flaws, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement.

## Overall Project Issues

### 1. Architectural and Structural Concerns
- **Code Duplication:** The `core/hardware_detector.py` file is identical in both `ffmpeg-gui` and `ffmpeg-server`. This is a significant maintenance risk. A shared library or module should be created to house common code.
- **Inconsistent Project Structure:** The `ffmpeg-gui` project contains a `shared` directory, but the `ffmpeg-server` project does not leverage it, leading to duplicated logic.
- **Lack of a Build System:** The project relies on manual installation scripts (`install_gui_mac.sh`, `install_gui_ubuntu.sh`, `install_ubuntu.sh`). A more robust build system like `setuptools` or `Poetry` would improve dependency management and distribution.

### 2. Code Quality and Style
- **Inconsistent Naming Conventions:** There is a mix of `snake_case` and `camelCase` for variable and function names, particularly in the GUI components.
- **Missing Docstrings and Type Hinting:** Many functions and methods lack proper documentation and type hints, making the code harder to understand and maintain.
- **Hardcoded Values:** Several files contain hardcoded values (e.g., "No output folder selected", default ports, and IP addresses) that should be managed through configuration.

### 3. Performance and Logic
- **Blocking I/O in GUI Thread:** Several GUI components perform blocking operations (e.g., `subprocess.run`) directly in the main thread, which can freeze the UI. These should be moved to separate threads or asynchronous tasks.
- **Inefficient File Handling:** The `WatcherEventHandler` in `gui/folder_watcher.py` processes file creation events without debouncing, which could lead to multiple events for a single file operation.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** Many parts of the code lack robust error handling, especially around file operations and network requests.

### 4. Documentation
- **Outdated `README.md`:** The `README.md` files are minimal and do not provide a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture, setup, or usage.
- **No Contribution Guidelines:** There are no guidelines for contributors, which makes it difficult for new developers to get involved.

## Folder and File Analysis

### `ffmpeg-gui`

#### `main.py`
- **Issue:** The `AsyncTkApp` class attempts to integrate `asyncio` with `Tkinter`, but the `_update_loop` implementation is inefficient and can lead to high CPU usage.
- **Suggestion:** Use a more standard approach for integrating `asyncio` with `Tkinter`, such as the `async-tkinter-loop` library or a more refined main loop.
- **Issue:** The fallback mechanism for `TkinterDnD2` is not robust and could be simplified.
- **Suggestion:** Encapsulate the `TkinterDnD2` initialization in a separate function to improve readability.

#### `core/app_controller.py`
- **Issue:** The `_is_media_file` and `_detect_media_type` methods use hardcoded sets of file extensions.
- **Suggestion:** Move these sets to a configuration file or a dedicated module to make them easier to update.
- **Issue:** The `_create_job_configuration` method has a `TODO` to handle multi-output jobs, but the current implementation only considers the first output.
- **Suggestion:** Implement the multi-output logic as intended.

#### `core/app_state.py`
- **Issue:** The `load_queue` method clears the job queue if all jobs are done, which might not be the desired behavior for a user who wants to review completed jobs.
- **Suggestion:** Add a separate mechanism for clearing completed jobs, rather than doing it automatically on load.
- **Issue:** The `notify_observers` method logs every observer call, which can be very noisy.
- **Suggestion:** Reduce the log level for these messages or make them conditional.

#### `core/capability_matcher.py`
- **Issue:** The `encoder_preferences` dictionary is hardcoded and not easily extensible.
- **Suggestion:** Move this to a configuration file.
- **Issue:** The `_parse_resolution` method has a simple fallback that may not be appropriate for all cases.
- **Suggestion:** Improve the resolution parsing to handle more formats or raise an error for unsupported formats.

#### `core/distributed_client.py`
- **Issue:** The `_reconnect_server` method uses an exponential backoff, but it does not have a maximum retry limit, which could lead to infinite retries.
- **Suggestion:** Add a maximum retry limit to the reconnection logic.
- **Issue:** The error handling for WebSocket connections is not comprehensive and could lead to unhandled exceptions.
- **Suggestion:** Add more specific error handling for different WebSocket connection errors.

#### `core/encode_job.py`
- **Issue:** The `OutputConfig` class has many attributes that are duplicated from the `EncodeJob` class, leading to data redundancy.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor the classes to have a clearer separation of concerns.
- **Issue:** The backward-compatibility properties are a temporary solution and should be removed once the refactoring is complete.
- **Suggestion:** Complete the refactoring to eliminate the need for these properties.

#### `core/ffmpeg_helpers.py`
- **Issue:** The `get_ffmpeg_encoders` function uses a global cache, which is not thread-safe.
- **Suggestion:** Use a thread-safe caching mechanism.
- **Issue:** The `available_codecs` method has a complex fallback mechanism that could be simplified.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor the method to have a clearer and more direct way of fetching codec information.

#### `core/hardware_detector.py`
- **Issue:** This file is duplicated in `ffmpeg-server`.
- **Suggestion:** Create a shared library for common code.

#### `core/job_scheduler.py`
- **Issue:** The `cancel_job` method is not fully implemented and has a `TODO` for server-side cancellation.
- **Suggestion:** Implement the server-side cancellation logic.
- **Issue:** The scheduler does not handle job priorities.
- **Suggestion:** Implement a priority queue for jobs.

#### `core/local_server.py`
- **Issue:** The `_monitor_job_progress` method simulates progress with a fixed value, which is not useful.
- **Suggestion:** Implement proper progress parsing from the FFmpeg output.
- **Issue:** The `is_available` method has a hardcoded limit of 2 jobs.
- **Suggestion:** Make this limit configurable.

#### `core/server_discovery.py`
- **Issue:** The `_monitor_servers_periodically` method does not handle the case where a server is removed while it is being monitored.
- **Suggestion:** Add a check to ensure the server still exists before attempting to ping it.

#### `core/settings.py`
- **Issue:** The `load_settings` function has a complex migration logic for old settings formats.
- **Suggestion:** Once all users have migrated to the new format, this logic can be simplified or removed.

#### `core/worker_pool.py`
- **Issue:** The `build_ffmpeg_stream` function is complex and hard to maintain.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor this function into smaller, more manageable parts.
- **Issue:** The `_run_job` method has a lot of nested logic, which makes it difficult to follow.
- **Suggestion:** Break down the method into smaller, more focused functions.

#### `gui/`
- **General Issue:** The GUI components are tightly coupled with the core logic, making it difficult to test and maintain them independently.
- **Suggestion:** Use a more structured architectural pattern like MVC or MVVM to separate the concerns.

### `ffmpeg-server`

#### `main.py`
- **Issue:** The signal handler for shutdown is basic and may not handle all edge cases gracefully.
- **Suggestion:** Use a more robust shutdown mechanism, such as the one provided by `asyncio`'s `loop.add_signal_handler`.

#### `server/config_manager.py`
- **Issue:** The `_parse_file_size` method is simple and may not handle all possible size formats.
- **Suggestion:** Use a more robust parsing library for file sizes.

#### `server/encode_server.py`
- **Issue:** The `handle_client` method has a lot of nested logic, which makes it difficult to follow.
- **Suggestion:** Refactor the method into smaller, more focused functions.
- **Issue:** The error handling for WebSocket connections is not comprehensive.
- **Suggestion:** Add more specific error handling for different WebSocket connection errors.

#### `server/file_manager.py`
- **Issue:** The `cleanup_old_files` method could be more efficient by using a more direct way to check file ages.
- **Suggestion:** Use a library like `watchdog` to monitor the temporary directory and clean up old files more proactively.

#### `server/job_processor.py`
- **Issue:** The `_monitor_progress` method uses regular expressions to parse FFmpeg's output, which can be brittle.
- **Suggestion:** Use a more structured output format from FFmpeg, such as JSON, if available.

### Configuration Files

#### `codecs.json`
- **Issue:** The structure is inconsistent, with video encoders being in a nested dictionary while audio and image encoders are in a flat list.
- **Suggestion:** Standardize the structure for all media types.

#### `presets.json`
- **Issue:** The presets are hardcoded and not easily extensible by the user.
- **Suggestion:** Provide a mechanism for users to add their own presets through the GUI.

#### `queue.json`
- **Issue:** This file can grow very large, and loading it all into memory at once can be inefficient.
- **Suggestion:** Use a more scalable solution for managing the job queue, such as a database.

#### `requirements.txt`
- **Issue:** The `ffmpeg-gui` `requirements.txt` file has a comment about verifying the `tkinterdnd2` version, which indicates uncertainty.
- **Suggestion:** Pin the exact version of `tkinterdnd2` that is known to work.
